# This is the main repository for desktop systems used at Megacorp.

We just use build on one operating system that is designed to be stable and immutable called Fedora SilverBlue.
Its a free and open-source system which means anyone can inspect the code and no single entity has control over its code.
We can then layer certain applications on top of the operating system to clearly track what programs have been installed.
This has a number of advantages but the primary one being that it grants a layer of anonyminity and security to the user.
